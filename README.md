# Optic-Disc-Segmentation
optic disc segmentation helps to detect various diseases and help doctors to get good idea about the diseases

The optic disc or optic nerve head is the point of exit for ganglion cell axons leaving the eye. Because there are no rods or cones overlying the optic disc, it corresponds to a small blind spot in each eye.



just download the dataset and see the jupyter notebook to check how to run the code.
i tried different models to segment it and got a result of segmentation with 98% accuracy.
